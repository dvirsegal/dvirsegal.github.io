        <p>Everybody has to eat, right? Families like to eat together, and friends frequently meet for dinner, and colleague regularly socialize over lunch.</p>
<p>Recent research by <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08959285.2015.1021049"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cornell University</a> found that employees who ate meals together had significantly better team performance at work than those who didn’t.</p>
<p>“During the study, we noticed that <strong>not sharing mealtimes was a signal that something deeper was wrong with the way the group worked</strong> , something that was then reflected in the team’s performance.” — <a href="https://www.morningfuture.com/en/article/2018/03/23/social-eating-team-building/260/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according</a> to Kevin Kniffin, Professor of Economics at Charles H. Dyson Cornell University, who published the research.</p>




<div style="text-align: center;">

    <p style="margin: 0; text-align: center;"><em>Eat alone</em></p>
</div>

<p>It means that eating alone makes you less efficient. Furthermore, I deduce that the importance of a team’s lunch ritual is comparable to eating with your family. It should be ingrained into the team’s culture to take the time to sit down and have meals together.</p>
<p>As a result, organizations that invest in cafeterias improve employee’s performance and collaboration. The right infrastructure provides a conversation starter in a space where colleagues can share their lunch and communicate better.</p>
<p>By now, I’m pretty sure you’ve already noticed that most of your awaken time is shared with this group of people. Practically, you see them more than your family which, and I guess, will be more fun if you know them better.</p>
<p>Hence, socializing with colleagues doesn’t end with a team’s lunch. From time to time, meeting outside of work in a bar, restaurant, or whatever fits the team’s unique DNA will lead to a stronger bond between team members.</p>

    <p style="margin: 0; text-align: center;"><em>Sculpt Team DNA</em></p>
</div>

<p>IMHO, every manager seeks for the secret of cultivating teams, that elusive chemistry which makes high achieving teams. A few years ago, a study named “<a href="https://hbr.org/2012/04/the-new-science-of-building-great-teams"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New Science of Building Great Teams</a>” looked at 21 organizations and 2500 employees over seven years, concluded that the following make a great team:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regularly face-to-face communication.</li>
<li>Psychological safety environment, where everyone can talk and listen equally. I mean everybody, not just the leaders do the talking.</li>
<li>Social time is critical; it accounts for more than 50% of positive changes in communication patterns — a game-changer between high-performing and low-performing teams.</li>
<li>Teams who tend to share knowledge between team-members perform better.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the above is facilitated simply by just eating together. A big surprise? I guess no; since it creates a fertile ground for them to flourish.</p>
<p>A significant hurdle to cross is deciding where to eat since each one has his own taste and food preferences. A suggested approach is using one of the collaborative tools which allow creating a Form (kind of survey) or a repetitive message where everyone shares what’s on their mind. The chosen option will be the one that the majority voted.</p>

    <p style="margin: 0; text-align: center;"><em>Lunch</em></p>
</div>

<p>For example, a connection between the <a href="https://products.office.com/en-US/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft Teams</a> and <a href="https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Micorosft Flow</a> services can be the solution. Flow generates a scheduled message into a specific Team’s channel where all team members are enlisted and can vote on their preferred choice. As can be seen below:</p>




<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/630/1*gIRsrcpAs6f24A2kMKhntg.png" alt="Flow recipe" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />
    <p style="margin: 0; text-align: center;"><em>Flow recipe</em></p>
</div>

<p>Naturally, on regular ( up to <a href="https://buffer.com/resources/small-teams-why-startups-often-win-against-google-and-facebook-the-science-behind-why-smaller-teams-get-more-done/amp"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two-pizza size</a> 🍕) team, it’s easier to schedule a shared lunch. In the case of a larger group, such cadence can be hard to achieve without a proper framework in place. Where only some days are defined as whole-team lunch, otherwise it will rarely happen due to the tendency to split into smaller groups with shared preferences.</p>
<p>Eventually, eating together creates an open dialogue that generates an informal talk and sparks innovative ideas. The firmer the bond between fellow workers, the more prolific the team gets.</p>
