      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s like learning to ride bicycles whole over again&#xD;Link to heading&#xD;As long as I recall my relationship with computers, I‚Äôve been using Windows.

If it can be modded or automated‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI‚Äôve done it.&#xA;Recently it all changed. üò±üò±üò±&#xA;I decided to take a new position.</description>

      <description>What is YAML? And how it works?&#xD;Link to heading&#xD;Recently I switched jobs, and as part of this change, I‚Äôve been introduced to a whole new tech stack. RabbitMQ üê∞, Java Spring, Docker, etc. (meaning more subjects to write about üòÇ). Most of the technologies I use on a daily basis consume YAML as their configuration. In this post, I‚Äôll try to illustrate what I‚Äôve learned (and from where) while trying to understand this new world.</description>

      <description>You can achieve almost anything by teamwork. Listening is a vital characteristic of a leader. Effectively communicating your thoughts is essential, as well. How you interact can positively and negatively affect the relationships you have in your work (and personal life too).&#xA;Effective communication is defined by various articles (#1, #2, #3, and more), and I challenge myself not to repeat them. I would like to give a different perspective on the matter.</description>

      <description>As time goes by, I‚Äôve started to find myself overwhelmed with things I would like to achieve. I looked for a solution to track my progress and goals. I tried various tools and found that writing each item and organize them in lists works for me. I felt immediate relief and ‚Äúin-control‚Äù of my things. Curios of the reason why‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit has drawn me to read about it and realizing that when writing things down, it frees your mind, clear space for more important topics.</description>

      <description>Being productive by taking control of your time&#xD;Link to heading&#xD;A gym workout, a reminder to walk the dog, meeting with your colleagues on that project presentation, a dentist appointment‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääare all on the same page. You can‚Äôt separate artificially between your work and personal calendars. Why? Because that‚Äôs how your life works. The goal is to see what your actual day looks like, to blend between work and personal life for finding the right balance that fits you.</description>

      <description>Writing about your code is redundant; the code is all you need. I can invest my time on unit tests or develop other features, and other excuses of why writing code comments is a waste of time. It‚Äôs a common belief among developers.&#xA;Well, you‚Äôve invested all your efforts in cultivating the design of your code, why should you comment it, right? As a result, code documentation is either absent or useless.</description>
