        <p>Everyone makes mistakes. If someone says otherwise, they’re probably not being straight with you. It’s bound to happen whether you’re new to a job or have been there for a while. You can find plenty of horror stories on Reddit and HackerNews. Take, for example, this post with a collection of those stories:</p>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7144934"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ask HN: What&rsquo;s the worst you&rsquo;ve ever screwed up at work? | Hacker News</a></p>
<p>I felt that gut-wrenching moment when you realize a mistake has been made. The sinking feeling in your stomach, the twinge of shame, or the self-critical thoughts might flood in.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing: mistakes are a natural part of the journey, and what matters most is how we navigate and <strong>learn from them</strong>. In this post, I’ll try to explain why.</p>




<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*Kx7_DnQ8zKk5FaFicxEyFA.png" alt="" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />

  Acknowledge and Own Up

    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h3>
<p>The first step is crucial — acknowledge the mistake. It’s tempting to sweep it under the rug or pass the blame, but trust me, that only makes things worse. Take responsibility and be brutally honest about what went wrong. Embrace the uncomfortable truth; it’s the only way forward.</p>
<p>Show that you’re proactive and committed to resolving the issue. Follow up and keep your team updated on your progress. Communicate clearly and frequently until the problem is solved.</p>
<p>Moreover, in my experience, there’s a hidden gem amid chaos — a chance to observe how people react. It’s like a crash course in understanding your company’s DNA. The way individuals handle mistakes reveals volumes about the organization’s culture.</p>

<h3 id="uncover-the-why">
  Uncover the Why

    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h3>
<p>Once you’ve owned up to the mistake, dive into detective mode to understand why it happened. Was it a knowledge gap, lack of training, or a hurried decision? This isn’t about pointing fingers but gaining insights.</p>
<p>Think of it as peeling an onion — layer by layer, get to the core of the issue. Was there a miscommunication or a systemic flaw? I can suggest using the 5 Whys technique. This is how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start with the problem statement and ask why it happened</li>
<li>For each answer, ask why again until you reach the root cause</li>
<li>Repeat the process for different aspects of the problem until you have a comprehensive picture of the situation.</li>
</ol>


    
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
      <iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" loading="eager" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FJ0eWm5PxkU?autoplay=0&controls=1&end=0&loop=0&mute=0&start=0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" title="YouTube video"
      ></iframe>
    </div>

<p>Understanding the why isn’t just for personal growth; it’s about making your team and organization more resilient.</p>
<p>By figuring out the root cause, you not only learn from your own slip-ups but also contribute to a shared knowledge base. Keep it simple, grab your metaphorical magnifying glass, and unravel the mysteries behind your mistakes.</p>

  Fix It, Learn from It

    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h3>
<p>Fixing the mistake is an obvious step, but don’t just gloss over it.</p>
<p>Don’t just patch the error; analyze it like a Git blame gone rogue. What went wrong? Was it a logic gap, a memory leak, or maybe a sneaky exception lurking in the shadows? Understanding the root cause is the key to unlocking points for future levels.</p>
<p>If you need a guide on how to start when it you against the issue, I once wrote a post about it:</p>
<p><a href="https://dvirsegal.github.io/posts/a-letter-to-the-lonely-developer-458f/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A letter to the lonely developer</a></p>
<p>Provide a high-level overview of what you did to resolve the issue, and accompany it with your key takeaways. Turning the page without reflecting on the lesson learned is a missed opportunity for personal and professional growth.</p>

  </a>
</h3>
<p>Now armed with insights, take proactive steps to prevent a repeat performance.</p>
<p>Knowledge is the ultimate firewall. Invest in training, devour documentation like it’s your favorite Stack Overflow thread, and consider adding unit tests like shields against future regressions, allocating more time for tasks, implementing new processes, or adding logs and metrics for better visibility.</p>

<p>Remember, prevention is the ultimate hack to keep bugs at bay.</p>

  </a>
</h3>
<p>Don’t let your hard-earned lessons be solo commits. Take a moment to reflect on the entire experience. Consider what could have been done differently and how you can improve professionally. Conduct a retrospective meeting with your team to discuss the mistake and the lessons learned. Use a structured format, such as the Start-Stop-Continue model, to identify what worked well, what didn’t work well, and what can be improved. Encourage everyone to participate and share their perspectives and suggestions.</p>

<p>Document your reflections and share them internally as part of a post-mortem. Transform your learning into collective wisdom, turning it into “stronger” code (and fewer regressions).</p>
<p>Below is a collection of some examples from very respectful companies:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/danluu/post-mortems"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Post mortem examples - GitHub repo</a></p>
<p>Lastly, embrace the “fail fast, iterate faster” mentality. Treat mistakes as experiments gone sideways, valuable data points in the grand algorithm of your career.</p>

<p>Mistakes are an inevitable part of the developer’s journey, but they are also invaluable learning experiences. Acknowledge, understand, fix, prevent, and reflect — these steps can turn a negative situation into a positive opportunity for growth. Remember, it’s not about avoiding mistakes altogether; it’s about handling them with resilience and turning them into stepping stones on your path to success. After all, everyone makes mistakes — it’s the journey of learning from them that truly matters.</p>
