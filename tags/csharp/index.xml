      <description>Investigating .NET assembly loading (binding) issues&#xD;Link to heading&#xD;Once in a while, you encounter that peculiar problem when you run your application and receive an exception saying TypeLoadException or FileNotFoundException even though the DLLs that your application relies on, are right there!&#xA;The first suspect that may jump to your head is an assembly binding issue since it happens at the moment you run your application. It might be a mix of old DLLs with new ones, mismatch in version numbers or cultures, missing assemblies at the applicationâ€™s folder, or even a probing failure, either of eachâ€Šâ€”â€Šfusion log viewer can assist in identifying the case.</description>

      <description>Back in 2016, I saw a demo at a conference about a new visual studio extension that presumes to change the way an engineer debugs, they called it, magic debugging. Little that I know, it turned my debugging way of thinking upside down, indeed a magical approach.&#xA;Before Iâ€™ll continue, I owe a disclaimer for the readers. A previous colleague of mine is one of OzCodeâ€™s co-founders (Omer Raviv). Although it might harm the credibility of this blog-post, Iâ€™ll take the risk; for the reason that these lines were written by a happy user ðŸ¤“.</description>

      <description>Occasionally youâ€™ll get into a situation where a problem happened in your application, and you donâ€™t have access to your source code and\or symbols.&#xA;At that moment, one of your better options is to decompile your code and debug it. IMHO, one of the best free tools out there is dnSpy, developed by 0xd4d (respect).&#xA;According to him, dnSpy is an improved ILSpy decompiler that enhanced by Roslyn (C# / Visual Basic) compiler and many other open source libraries.</description>
