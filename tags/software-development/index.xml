      <description>My humble opinion on who should be included in your code review&#xD;Link to heading&#xD;An educated guess that from time to time, youâ€™ve encountered the question of who should be involved in code reviews. Well, my colleagues and I found ourselves dealing with it, and the arguments about whatâ€™s the proper way, go in various directions; Hence Iâ€™ve decided to get to the bottom of this critical subject and write my views.</description>

      <description>Investigating .NET assembly loading (binding) issues&#xD;Link to heading&#xD;Once in a while, you encounter that peculiar problem when you run your application and receive an exception saying TypeLoadException or FileNotFoundException even though the DLLs that your application relies on, are right there!&#xA;The first suspect that may jump to your head is an assembly binding issue since it happens at the moment you run your application. It might be a mix of old DLLs with new ones, mismatch in version numbers or cultures, missing assemblies at the applicationâ€™s folder, or even a probing failure, either of eachâ€Šâ€”â€Šfusion log viewer can assist in identifying the case.</description>

      <description>Back in 2016, I saw a demo at a conference about a new visual studio extension that presumes to change the way an engineer debugs, they called it, magic debugging. Little that I know, it turned my debugging way of thinking upside down, indeed a magical approach.&#xA;Before Iâ€™ll continue, I owe a disclaimer for the readers. A previous colleague of mine is one of OzCodeâ€™s co-founders (Omer Raviv). Although it might harm the credibility of this blog-post, Iâ€™ll take the risk; for the reason that these lines were written by a happy user ðŸ¤“.</description>

      <description>Copy-pasting is one of those things that you do every day while working on a computer. By doing so, each time you invest a small portion of your daily routine.&#xA;Say you want to share a photo\text\whatever with a friend from a website, you copy it, either by right-clicking on it and copying it to the clipboard or using Ctrl+C and then paste it to your favorite sharing application and after doing so, youâ€™ve realized you want to share it again with another person.</description>

      <description>Few years ago a teammate changed my perspective of my daily computerâ€™s usage experience. Until that moment, I used to go and explore folder and files using Windows Explorer as Microsoft intended, but something was wrong with it, too many clicks and the start menu search need some improvements. Overall, it felt so different than my common internet browsing experience, where you open your favorite search engine and start typing whatever youâ€™re looking for.</description>
