      <description>My humble opinion on who should be included in your code review&#xD;Link to heading&#xD;An educated guess that from time to time, you’ve encountered the question of who should be involved in code reviews.

      <description>Investigating .NET assembly loading (binding) issues&#xD;Link to heading&#xD;Once in a while, you encounter that peculiar problem when you run your application and receive an exception saying TypeLoadException or FileNotFoundException even though the DLLs that your application relies on, are right there!&#xA;The first suspect that may jump to your head is an assembly binding issue since it happens at the moment you run your application. It might be a mix of old DLLs with new ones, mismatch in version numbers or cultures, missing assemblies at the application’s folder, or even a probing failure, either of each — fusion log viewer can assist in identifying the case.</description>

By doing so, each time you invest a small portion of your daily routine.&#xA;Say you want to share a photo\text\whatever with a friend from a website, you copy it, either by right-clicking on it and copying it to the clipboard or using Ctrl+C and then paste it to your favorite sharing application and after doing so, you’ve realized you want to share it again with another person.</description>
