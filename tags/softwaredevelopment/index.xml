      <description>What is YAML? And how it works?&#xD;Link to heading&#xD;Recently I switched jobs, and as part of this change, I‚Äôve been introduced to a whole new tech stack. RabbitMQ üê∞, Java Spring, Docker, etc. (meaning more subjects to write about üòÇ). Most of the technologies I use on a daily basis consume YAML as their configuration.

I can invest my time on unit tests or develop other features, and other excuses of why writing code comments is a waste of time.
