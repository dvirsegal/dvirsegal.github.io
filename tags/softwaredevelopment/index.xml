      <description>This is the last post in the simplify docker series ( if you haven&amp;rsquo;t read the previous ones, go ahead and read them, it will make more sense afterward‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääpart I &amp;amp; part II). This time I‚Äôll cover networks, docker-compose, docker volumes, and more.&#xA;What is it all about with docker-compose?&#xD;Link to heading&#xD;Docker-compose allows you to define and run multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you configure your app‚Äôs services using YAML files (more on YAML here).</description>

      <description>I covered the basics of creating and building Docker images in part I (if you haven‚Äôt read that yet, I would recommend it since this part is based on it). In this part, I‚Äôll explain how to run and delete an image of the container you‚Äôve built.&#xA;let‚Äôs continue&#xA;Running an image is as simple as docker run -it image_name:tag . Let‚Äôs break it down; tag is the one you set when building it; note that if you remove it, then docker assumes you point to the latest.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôve heard a lot about dockers, even had some experience with it as part of my graduate degree. Still, as the old saying goes, learning is by doing. By doing, I mean using the stuff you want to learn as part of your daily work (instead of using it as part of a course in a semester since it will be forgotten). Actually, this is a technology that, in my perspective, should be in some familiarity level in each software engineer‚Äôs tech stack.</description>

      <description>What is YAML? And how it works?&#xD;Link to heading&#xD;Recently I switched jobs, and as part of this change, I‚Äôve been introduced to a whole new tech stack. RabbitMQ üê∞, Java Spring, Docker, etc. (meaning more subjects to write about üòÇ). Most of the technologies I use on a daily basis consume YAML as their configuration. In this post, I‚Äôll try to illustrate what I‚Äôve learned (and from where) while trying to understand this new world.</description>

      <description>On the focused effort of making a working prototype&#xD;Link to heading&#xD;There are many ways you can determine whether a new feature will add value to the product or turn out to be a complete waste of time. For instance, you can undertake user research, analyze the demands of the market, and study existing solutions. However, we (developers) have a fantastic tool in our sleeves: Developing a running project that demonstrates the proposed solution‚Äôs key ideas is your optimal option‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääin my opinion.</description>

      <description>My personal experience to jump off the bandwagon (effect)&#xD;Link to heading&#xD;Imagine the following situation. One of your experienced colleagues talks about doing some work, which she‚Äôs passionate about and sure it will provide better results for the team.

      <description>Tools and techniques for exploring an unknown (large) codebase&#xD;Link to heading&#xD;You‚Äôve received a new responsibility or walked into a new job where there is existing code to work with. The source control has been introduced to you, realizing you have a lot to learn. Now what? Asking yourself, how should I become acquainted with the new codebase? Which for some, may be intimidating. Below I‚Äôll attempt to illustrate my techniques for getting familiarity with the code, leading to structured knowledge.</description>

      <title>Code comments are your code autobiography</title>

      <description>Writing about your code is redundant; the code is all you need. I can invest my time on unit tests or develop other features, and other excuses of why writing code comments is a waste of time. It‚Äôs a common belief among developers.&#xA;Well, you‚Äôve invested all your efforts in cultivating the design of your code, why should you comment it, right? As a result, code documentation is either absent or useless.</description>
