      <description>What is YAML? And how it works?&#xD;Link to heading&#xD;Recently I switched jobs, and as part of this change, I‚Äôve been introduced to a whole new tech stack. RabbitMQ üê∞, Java Spring, Docker, etc. (meaning more subjects to write about üòÇ). Most of the technologies I use on a daily basis consume YAML as their configuration. In this post, I‚Äôll try to illustrate what I‚Äôve learned (and from where) while trying to understand this new world.</description>

      <description>Writing about your code is redundant; the code is all you need. I can invest my time on unit tests or develop other features, and other excuses of why writing code comments is a waste of time. It‚Äôs a common belief among developers.&#xA;Well, you‚Äôve invested all your efforts in cultivating the design of your code, why should you comment it, right? As a result, code documentation is either absent or useless.</description>
