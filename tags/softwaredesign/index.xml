      <description>Or let‚Äôs talk about cohesion&#xD;Link to heading&#xD;TL;DR To make a system cohesive, you must ensure that the parts that go together are close to one another.&#xA;I sometimes find that the cohesion (and coupling) concept is often considered way too academic, and developers tend to talk about other well-known concepts, such as DRY, YAGNI, KISS, and SRP. The list is long, and I can continue with more acronyms all day üòÇ So, I‚Äôve chosen to challenge myself and simplify it.</description>

      <description>The aspects of code complexity are broad; one of them result from the design of our code. Design weight is the cognitive effort reading and maintaining your code‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa metaphor used for emphasizing how it weighs down your progress.&#xA;The main symptom (as I encountered) is code that forces you to remember specific areas to connect the dots between them. While relying on your memory has its benefits but also a capacity, leading to losing details, causing you to re-read with an effort to memorize it, reducing motivation to be engaged with the product.</description>
