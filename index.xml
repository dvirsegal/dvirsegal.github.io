      <description>What is YAML? And how it works?&#xD;Link to heading&#xD;Recently I switched jobs, and as part of this change, I’ve been introduced to a whole new tech stack. RabbitMQ 🐰, Java Spring, Docker, etc. (meaning more subjects to write about 😂). Most of the technologies I use on a daily basis consume YAML as their configuration. In this post, I’ll try to illustrate what I’ve learned (and from where) while trying to understand this new world.</description>

      <description>Me against a bug, reminding myself how to solve any defect&#xD;Link to heading&#xD;Dear developer,&#xA;Don’t give up, keep up with your efforts to find other ways to understand the bug’s root cause. I know it can be frustrating. The agonies with the process can be ruff. But, you’ve got it, you solved many in the past, and you will solve this one too. It is part of your job.</description>

      <description>Being productive by taking control of your time&#xD;Link to heading&#xD;A gym workout, a reminder to walk the dog, meeting with your colleagues on that project presentation, a dentist appointment — are all on the same page. You can’t separate artificially between your work and personal calendars. Why? Because that’s how your life works. The goal is to see what your actual day looks like, to blend between work and personal life for finding the right balance that fits you.</description>

      <description>Hey, I’m Dvir 🙋🏻‍♂️&#xA;nI’m curious by nature. I love reading and learning new stuff, mainly about SW development. It feels like I’m on a sort of a quest for knowledge.&#xA;I genuinely believe there’s no such thing as a stupid question. If you have one? don’t hesitate to reach out; my Twitter DM is open 🍻</description>
