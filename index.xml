      <description>How we used integration tests to improve confidence in our code&#xD;Link to heading&#xD;Picture this: your product owner brings you a set of new requirements, and together you review them. After some preparation and initial work, you get your design reviewed and approved by relevant stakeholders. Then, you enter your focus zone and start implementing it. While doing so, you want to gain confidence, so you add tons of unit tests to cover it, manually test it, and refactor your code based on your tests&amp;rsquo; results until you feel comfortable with the outcome.</description>

      <description>Or let‚Äôs talk about cohesion&#xD;Link to heading&#xD;TL;DR To make a system cohesive, you must ensure that the parts that go together are close to one another.&#xA;I sometimes find that the cohesion (and coupling) concept is often considered way too academic, and developers tend to talk about other well-known concepts, such as DRY, YAGNI, KISS, and SRP. The list is long, and I can continue with more acronyms all day üòÇ So, I‚Äôve chosen to challenge myself and simplify it.</description>

      <description>Various methods I use to gain new knowledge&#xD;Link to heading&#xD;A few years ago, I started my journey; picture this, a recent undergraduate SW engineer on his first full-time day job.

They even found the time to be up to date with general tech news. I thought to myself, how do they do that?</description>

      <description>I covered the basics of creating and building Docker images in part I (if you haven‚Äôt read that yet, I would recommend it since this part is based on it).

Let‚Äôs break it down; tag is the one you set when building it; note that if you remove it, then docker assumes you point to the latest.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôve heard a lot about dockers, even had some experience with it as part of my graduate degree. Still, as the old saying goes, learning is by doing. By doing, I mean using the stuff you want to learn as part of your daily work (instead of using it as part of a course in a semester since it will be forgotten). Actually, this is a technology that, in my perspective, should be in some familiarity level in each software engineer‚Äôs tech stack.</description>

You get well-defined requirements, review them, ask questions, adjust them with your product owner, and prepared one heck of SW design. Soon after, the implementation phase begins, and a few hours or days before the end of the story, the business calls and asks for an extra feature (or change) to be implemented.</description>
