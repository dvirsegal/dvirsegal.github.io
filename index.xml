      <description>What is YAML? And how it works?&#xD;Link to heading&#xD;Recently I switched jobs, and as part of this change, I‚Äôve been introduced to a whole new tech stack. RabbitMQ üê∞, Java Spring, Docker, etc. (meaning more subjects to write about üòÇ). Most of the technologies I use on a daily basis consume YAML as their configuration. In this post, I‚Äôll try to illustrate what I‚Äôve learned (and from where) while trying to understand this new world.</description>

      <description>Me against a bug, reminding myself how to solve any defect&#xD;Link to heading&#xD;Dear developer,&#xA;Don‚Äôt give up, keep up with your efforts to find other ways to understand the bug‚Äôs root cause. I know it can be frustrating. The agonies with the process can be ruff. But, you‚Äôve got it, you solved many in the past, and you will solve this one too. It is part of your job.</description>

      <description>My humble opinion on the necessity of a check-in process&#xD;Link to heading&#xD;Are you familiar with the situation of getting a code review that is being delayed by your peer reviewer‚Äôs nitpicking for filling his code perfection aspirations? Unable to commit due to build server failure? Personal preferences overruled over technical facts?&#xA;Let me see your unit tests&#xA;All the above are examples of the necessity of a well-defined procedure, guiding us in various situations we encounter daily.</description>

      <description>You can achieve almost anything by teamwork. Listening is a vital characteristic of a leader. Effectively communicating your thoughts is essential, as well. How you interact can positively and negatively affect the relationships you have in your work (and personal life too).&#xA;Effective communication is defined by various articles (#1, #2, #3, and more), and I challenge myself not to repeat them. I would like to give a different perspective on the matter.</description>

      <description>Being productive by taking control of your time&#xD;Link to heading&#xD;A gym workout, a reminder to walk the dog, meeting with your colleagues on that project presentation, a dentist appointment‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääare all on the same page. You can‚Äôt separate artificially between your work and personal calendars. Why? Because that‚Äôs how your life works. The goal is to see what your actual day looks like, to blend between work and personal life for finding the right balance that fits you.</description>

      <title>Code comments are your code autobiography</title>

      <description>Writing about your code is redundant; the code is all you need. I can invest my time on unit tests or develop other features, and other excuses of why writing code comments is a waste of time. It‚Äôs a common belief among developers.&#xA;Well, you‚Äôve invested all your efforts in cultivating the design of your code, why should you comment it, right? As a result, code documentation is either absent or useless.</description>
